# GifExtension

This project is how you can you use gifs in Image View

I've wrote the extension for image view

You can add the Extension/ImageView.swift file in to your project and can easily use gifs in your project

To use gif in UIImageView creat imageView and call this function

imageView.gifImage(gifURL: gifUrl, withAnimationDuration: 3.0)

gifUrl is basically the url for you gif

withAnimationDuration is for how fast or slow you want to animate your gif (Default is set to 1.0
